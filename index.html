                        <p align="justify">Just Clean Window Cleaning uses one key ingredient: pure water! Purified water is delivered through a purification system that hooks up straight from your home’s water spigots. This means that your windows are cleaned without chemical additives. There is no residue or buildup on the surface and it leaves windows spot free after drying!</p>
                      </div>
                      <div class="col-sm-4">
                        <p align="justify">Besides spot and streak free windows, this all-in-one system has other benefits! With a specialized pole we can clean the outsides of most homes or businesses from the ground, which means there is less risk of accidents and saves time. It also means that there is no risk of damage to property. There are no ladders or scaffolding that mark walls and windowsills.</p>

                        <p align="justify">If you notice that your windows are not cleaned to your satisfaction, give us a call. We would be happy to return within two days time to clean the windows that have water drops or marks.</p>

                        <p align="justify">It is our policy to hold our work appointments even in the case of rain. Light rain will not affect the cleaning. In the event of heavy rain we will return within one or two days to complete any outside windows that couldn’t be cleaned during the original appointment. Interiors of windows will be completed as scheduled to prevent disruptions to your schedule.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Dirt is what makes your windows dirty, not rain! It is the dust from things like landscapers, tree pollen, car exhaust. Raindrops move the dirt on your windows, and their drying makes it appears as though the rain drops are what is causing your windows to become dirty. Clean windows remain clean after the rain because once the water has dried there will be no dirt left to obscure the view through your windows!</p>

                        <i><b>Can windows be cleaned in the winter?</i></b>
                        <p align="justify">Yes! Window cleaning may be even more important during the winter season. Road salt becomes an airborne powder after it has been driven on. It settles on your window just as any other dust would. We follow proper safety guidelines so that your winter servicing is completed safely and to your satisfaction.</p>
