                    <p align="justify">Unlike other window cleaning services, Just Clean Window Cleaning uses one key ingredient to wash windows without spots or streaks: <strong>pure water</strong>! Purified water is delivered through a purification system that hooks up straight from your home’s water spigots. This means that your windows are cleaned without chemical additives. There is no residue or buildup on the surface and it leaves windows spot free after drying!</p>

                    <p align="justify">Besides spot and streak free windows, this all-in-one system has other benefits! With a specialized pole we can clean the outsides of most homes or businesses from the ground, which means there is less risk of accidents and saves time. It also means that there is no risk of damage to property. There are no ladders or scaffolding that can create unsightly marks on walls and windowsills.</p>

                    <i><b>What happens to my appointment in case of rain?</i></b>
                    <p align="justify">It is our policy to hold our work appointments even in the case of rain. Light rain will not affect the cleaning. In the event of heavy rain we will return within one or two days to complete any outside windows that couldn’t be cleaned during the original appointment. Interiors of windows will be completed as scheduled to prevent disruptions to your schedule.</p>

                    <i><b>Does rain make my windows dirty?</i></b>
                    <p align="justify">Dirt is what makes your windows dirty, not rain! The dirt and dust you see on your window comes from surrounding sources such as landscapers, tree pollen, and car exhaust. Raindrops move the dirt on your windows, and their drying makes it appear as though the rain drops are causing your windows to become dirty. Clean windows remain clean after the rain, because once the water has dried there will be no dirt left to obscure the view through your windows!<br />
                    If it rains within 24 hours after your exterior window cleaning, call us back the next business day and we will come by for a free touch-up on any affected windows.</p>

                    <i><b>Can windows be cleaned in the winter?</i></b>
                    <p align="justify">Yes! Window cleaning may be even more important during the winter season. Road salt becomes an airborne powder after it has been driven on. It settles on your window just as any other dust. We follow proper safety guidelines so that your winter servicing is completed safely and to your satisfaction. If your windows are not washed over the winter, it is important to wash them in the early spring to prevent hard-to-remove stains.</p>

                <i><b>Do I have to be home during my service appointment?</b></i>
                <p align="justify">If only your exterior windows are going to be washed, then you do not need to be home at the time of your appointment. If you want your interior windows washed then you will need to be home to allow us inside. If you are not expecting to be home during your appointment arrangements for payment must be made in advance.</p>
