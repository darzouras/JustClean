                        <h3>Ask us about hard water stain removal!</h3>
                        <p>Hard water stains are difficult to remove and may not disappear completely during your routine window washing. Hard water stains build up when water with high mineral content evaporates on your windows, leaving white spots.</p>
                        <p>Because of this, hard water stain removal and sealing are not included in our regular service prices. However, the additional cost is quite reasonable and can be added to your regular cleaning on a per-pane basis.</p>
